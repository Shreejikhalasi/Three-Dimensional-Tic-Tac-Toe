Using a heuristic that will allow us to find the optimal
moves for playing 3DTicTacToe. This will allow us to use the A* search algorithm. We
will also be using Min-Max with alpha beta pruning to find the optimal moves to make
and we can play against the program and choose if the program should use the best
moves possible or the worst.
